SpaceWars Client - PS7 
Created for CS 3500 2017 Fall Semester

Initial Design Ideas: The GUI will need three panels. One panel is the top bar which will be a tableLayoutPanel and  
the side and center panel will be custom. The side panel will contian the scoreboard and the center one will be the 
game. The size of the form will resize when the server send the proper information. 

What works: We were able to get everything to work. We did a lot of troubleshooting and debugging to get everything 
working. The hardest part to get correct was the GUI. We struggled with updating the information to the GUI correctly 
without causing problems or errors. 

What didn't work: We really struggled with getting the scoreboard to work properly since the health points would 
not update. We did a lot of debugging to get it to work. We also had problems with the black color player not filling 
in the scoreboard color in everytime. 

Notes for the TAs: Our project was setup in an the proper MVC format. We used the proper abstraction so that the 
different classes could speak to each other and work together to create a fuctional spreadsheet GUI. 

Added Features: Our scoreboard is color coordinated and our GUI has a fun Santa Claus theme. We picked a white 
background to represent the snow. 

How to Run: Start the server. Once the server is ready, press start on the client code. Enter in a name and press connect.
